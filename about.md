  <p>My name is Michael Stezycki and I’m a designer with an interest in prototyping, design systems and the intersection of business and technology.</p>
  <p>Raised in East London and eventually the West Midlands, I studied Interactive Media at Stratford-upon-Avon College and passed with a distinction, distinction, merit. My childhood love of making crude websites and icons grew into a adulthood love of designing and building simple, well thought-out digital products for people. My fascination with technology hasn't stopped, and I’ve been fascinated by how it can change lives for the better as well as understanding its addictive effects on society.</p>
  <p>As well as designing digital products, I also have a shutter bug and love to take photos in new and exotic places. I’m a firm believer of the fact that travel broadens the mind&mdash;Yes, I stole that from Stephen Merchant and I’m not even sorry.<br><br>
