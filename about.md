  <p>My name is Michael Stezycki, I'm a competent and enthusiastic designer with a keen eye for small details, living in the United Kingdom. I love creating great experiences through beautifully crafted systems tempered by a solid foundation of understanding.</p>
  <p>I currently work as a visual designer for Wonder PL, creating stunning visuals for their video platform. Previously, I worked with automotive company, Listers and helped launch their new responsive website with a focus on content. I have also worked freelance in the past delivering websites to clients throughout the UK, as well as working with online advertiser Styles Creative on various projects.</p>
  <p>I enjoy taking photos. Last year, I had the opportunity to backpack around parts of Southeast Asia for 3 months and see in the new year from Vietnam. Photos from the trip can be seen on <a href="https://mr-stezz.exposure.so">Exposure</a>, <a href="http://stezz.vsco.co">VSCO Grid</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mikestezy">Flickr</a>. I have <a href="http://www.rdio.com/people/mr_stezz/">music</a> playing regularly, I like many facets of design, including architecture and typography, I enjoy a good meal here and there and love to travel. I hope to embark on another journey to travel the world in the near future with places like Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico and the US on the list of places to see.</p>
