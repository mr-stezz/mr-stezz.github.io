  <p>I'm a designer interested in designing and building products and tools that help people achieve a better 'self'.</p>
  <p>From a young age I've been interested in what individuals could achieve with technology and how it can enpower people's lives. I currently work in London for the global opinion network, Stateâ€”where I work with engineering and community teams to help grow our user base.</p>
  <p>As well as design for digital products, I also have a soft spot for photography and enjoy taking photos from time to time.</p>
