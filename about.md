  <p>My name is Michael Stezycki and I'm a designer interested in designing and building products and tools that leave the environment and us humans in a better state than before.</p>
  <p>From a young age I've been fascinated about what individuals can achieve with technology and how it can empower people's lives and circumstances. I currently work in London, UK for the incubator and accelerator, Founders Factory. With a bright team of individuals, we conceptualise and tease out problems to solve with our corporate partners and ultimately bring to life industry disrupting products and services.</p>
  <p>As well as designing digital products, I also have a shutter bug and love to take photos and travel to new and exciting places.</p>
