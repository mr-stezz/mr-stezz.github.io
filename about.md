  <p>
    My name is Michael <dfn title="[ste-zee-key]">Ste&middot;zy&middot;cki</dfn> and I design digital product experiences with an interest in storytelling through prototyping, efficiency in design systems and the intersection of business and technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raised in East London and later the West Midlands, I studied Interactive Media at Stratford-upon-Avon College and passed with a distinction, distinction, merit. My childhood love of making crude websites and icons grew into a adulthood love of designing and building simple, well thought-out digital products for people. My fascination with technology hasn't stopped, and I’ve been blown away by what <abbr title="Augmented Reality/Mixed Reality">AR/MR</abbr> can do and how it can change lives for the better as well as learning about tech's uglier effects on society.
  </p>
  <p>
    As well as designing digital products, I also have a shutter bug and love to take photos in new and exotic places. I’m a firm believer of the fact that travel broadens the mind—yes, I stole that from Stephen Merchant and I’m not even sorry.<br><br>
