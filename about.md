  <p>My name is Michael Stezycki and I'm a designer interested in designing and building products and tools that leave the world and its inhabitants in a better state than before.</p>
  <p>From a young age I've been fascinated about what individuals could achieve with technology and how it can empower people's lives. I currently work in London, UK for the incubator and accelerator, Founders Factory&mdash;where I work with a bright team of individuals conceptualising and bringing to life industry disrupting products and services.</p>
  <p>As well as designing digital products, I also have a soft spot for photography and travel and enjoy exploring new places and taking photos from time to time.</p>
