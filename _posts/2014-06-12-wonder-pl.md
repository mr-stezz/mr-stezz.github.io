  <p class="lede">Wonder Place is a content platform full of quality videos. It exists to bring you the best in video content on a plethora of topics, carefully curated by skilled editors.</p>
  <p>At Wonder Place I was a user experience and visual designer on the iOS app for iPhone and iPad, and also a platform for the web, internally named &lsquo;Romeo.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>During that time I worked with an amazing team of developers as well as talented designers on introducing Wonder to the web and reintroducing it to the iOS platform.</p>
