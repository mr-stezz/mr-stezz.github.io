title: Designing for People, not Users
subtitle: &ldquo;it is easy to demoralize a first-timer, but we must keep in mind that the state of beginner-hood is never an objective.&rdquo;

<p class="lede">When Julie Zhou published The Death of “Users” and “Product Design” she virally launched Mark Zuckerberg’s “people, not users” philosophy across the internet. Ever since then, I have been focusing more on the people I design for. I try to be quick and catch myself when I slip up and accidentally refer to someone as a user. I try to spread the change in language as unobtrusively as I can, hopefully working the philosophy into the products I help build and root it in the culture as honestly and organically possible.</p>
Still there are times throughout my day when I slip up. I’ve been thinking about those slip ups and how they do little to promote the more empathetic and compassionate culture we as designers try to build.
I was reminded of Julie’s article and Mark’s philosophy the other day while reading About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design, for a couple of reasons:

* The use of the term “users” in this book is unbelievable. I almost want to count to see just how many times they mention the word.
* However, it still articulates the immense consideration for empathy and compassion that is required to design for people.

Also, this book is incredible and I suggest every designer read it.

> Beginners are undeniably sensitive, and it is easy to demoralize a first-timer, but we must keep in mind that the state of beginner-hood is never an objective. Nobody wants to remain a beginner. It is merely a rite of passage everyone must experience. Good software shortens that passage without bringing attention to it.

> As an interaction designer, it’s best to imagine that users — especially beginners — are simultaneously very intelligent and very busy. They need some instruction, but not very much, and the process has to be rapid and targeted… Just because a user needs to learn how to operate a product doesn’t mean that they need or want to learn how it works inside.

### Design principle: Imagine users as very intelligent but very busy.
