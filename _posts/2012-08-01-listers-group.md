<div class="text-col t--center">
  <p class="lede">In 2012 I helped design the flagship website of Listers Group, the largest privately owned car and van dealer in the UK, operating in the Midlands.</p>
  <p>Together with <a href="https://twitter.com/im_aaron_">Aaron Stezycki</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/abitgone">Anthony Williams</a>, we designed a new visual style for the site, with an approach to modularising components, using scalable graphics and making the experience more holistic.</p>
  <p>Listers was also my first real foray into the world of Github.</p>
