  <p class="lede">In 2012, I designed the flagship website of Listers Group, a privately owned car and van dealer operating in the West Midlands, UK.</p>
  <p>Together with <a href="http://twitter.com/abitgone">Anthony Williams</a>, we created a mobile strategy for Listers, making the content mobile friendly and scalable. I created wireframes, and designed primarily in the browser.</p>
  <p>Listers was also my first real foray into the world of Github.</p>
