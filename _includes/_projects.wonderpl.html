  <p class="text-col">Wonder Place was a premium video mobile service for iOS. It boasted curated videos in categories like creativity, health and wellness among others. I worked on improving the UX and UI for the iOS app as well as a new monetisation feature. I also worked on the front-end for a new web based video project management app aiming to improve relationships between indie movie makers and studios.</p>
