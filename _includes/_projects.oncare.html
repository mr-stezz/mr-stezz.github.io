    <a href="http://www.weareoncare.com" title="We save care agencies time and money by replacing paper records with a simple app, help to boost CQC ratings, and keep families closer to their loved ones' care.">OnCare</a> is a <abbr title="Business-to-Business">B2B</abbr> <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> business from the <a href="https://foundersfactory.com/portfolio/">Founders Factory incubator</a>. OnCare provides tools that saves costs to Care Agencies and make caring for the elderly easier. The business has three apps which I helped prototype and design. This includes a React Native app for both iOS and Android and a responsive web app. I worked on product strategy, prototypes and informing the user experience, as well as the creative direction.
