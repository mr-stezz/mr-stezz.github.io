    <a href="https://theculturetrip.com" title="Location based inspiration and content to make you feel like a local, everywhere.">Culture Trip</a> is a content, e-commerce and technology company in the travel vertical.<br>
    <br>I joined as a product designer to work alongside the small product and tech team, based in Tel Aviv, on improving the website and native mobile apps. In early 2018, the company raised 80 million dollars in a series B round, continuing its mission to shine a light on different cultures worldwide. I focused on improving conversions for an affiliate booking program.<br>
    <br>After seeing some initial positive signals, the company decided to enter the <abbr title="Online Travel Agent">OTA</abbr> space, I designed the first round of the booking experience.<br>
    <br>After that, I focused on experiments that drove traffic around the site directing our readers to conversion opportunities.<br>
    <br>Continuing on, I worked within the content and community squad, responsible for designing content production experiences for our freelancers in the form of our very own 'Creator App' web app.<br>
    <br>I am now working on improving booking related experiences across our website and both of our native mobile apps which you can download from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/culture-trip-explore-travel/id1146832951">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=culturetrip.com&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">Play Store</a>, respectively.</p>
