    <a href="https://theculturetrip.com" title="Location based inspiration and content to make you feel like a local, everywhere.">Culture Trip</a> is a content, e-commerce and technology company in the travel vertical. Operating since 2011, its mission was to shine a light on different cultures around the world.

  <p class="text-col u--m-bottom--large">
    In 2017 I joined as a product designer to work alongside the small product and tech team, based in London and majority in Tel Aviv, on improving the website and native mobile apps. I spent time refining parts of the website functionality and improving parts of the native mobile apps like the App Store rating prompt as well as other things.<br>
    <br>
    In early 2018, the company raised 80 million dollars in a series B round and went through a period of hyper growth. I focused on improving conversions for an affiliate booking program together with a Product Manager in London and a handful of developers in Tel Aviv in a small Growth squad.

  <h4 id="ota" class="heading delta">Online Travel Agent&nbsp;<a href="#ota" class="subtitle-link" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
  <p class="text-col u--m-bottom--large">
    After seeing some initial positive signals, the company decided to enter the <abbr title="Online Travel Agent">OTA</abbr> space and position itself as a curated boutique hotel specialist. I designed the first round of the hotel booking web experience from entry point through to product page and to checkout and confirmation/cancellation.

  <p class="text-col u--m-bottom--large">
    I later joined a newly formed team named Pathways to Purchase and focused on experiments that drove traffic around the site to conversion opportunities. Whilst with this team, I also designed a scalable system of banner formats for the web that key messaging could take the form of. The system later became a part of what was known as Yantra and would manage dynamically placed house ads and banners on the site in key areas.

  <h4 id="cops" class="heading delta">Content &amp; Community&nbsp;<a href="#cops" class="subtitle-link" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
  <p class="text-col u--m-bottom--large">
    I was given the opportunity to switch teams after being within P2P for a while. I worked within the content and community squad for 6 months, responsible for designing content production experiences. The business needed to reduce costs and automate workflows relating to commissioning content from our global 300+ freelance network of creatives. The ambition was to create a competitive marketplace for our freelance writers, illustrators and photographers to pick up work and deliver on time and within budget saving the company service and operational costs.

  <p class="text-col u--m-bottom--large">
    As the business shifted focus to bookable related experiences, I worked on improving said experiences across our website and both of our native mobile apps.

  <p class="text-col u--m-bottom--large">
    Within the Bookable Squad, I designed all the native checkout experiences for both hotels and our experiences for the app. Before having a native checkout, we used web views which provided a passable experience, but not one users of our app came to expect.

  <p class="text-col u--m-bottom--large">
    Also within the Bookable Squad, I designed how Apple Pay would work via the web checkout on supported browsers and devices and the mobile iOS app natively. I also sat in with the developers and offered a technical solution to implement the Apple Pay button on the web.

  <h4 id="apps" class="heading delta">Shifting Focus to Apps&nbsp;<a href="#apps" class="subtitle-link" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
  <p class="text-col u--m-bottom--large">
    I moved teams again as focus shifted on improving the native mobile apps. I started to conduct an audit of screens to begin the process of aligning the design across screens and bring them into a unified design system while still respecting platform specifics. This was sadly short lived.

    Now, I'm offering my services to support the business and help them transition to a new business operation as they close down both hotels and experience businesses and focus on multi-day small group trips.
