  <p class="text-col"><a href="https://theculturetrip.com" title="Location based inspiration and content to make you feel like a local, everywhere.">Culture Trip</a> is a media, entertainment and technology company in the travel vertical. I joined as a product designer to work alongside the small product team on improving the website and native mobile apps. In early 2018, the company raised 80 million dollars in a seried B round, continuing its mission to shine a light on different cultures worldwide. I focused on improving conversions for an affiliate booking program. After seeing improvements, the company decided to enter the <abbr title="Online Travel Agent">OTA</abbr> space, I designed the first round of the booking experience. Since then, I now continue to design experiments around the site to drive traffic.</p>
