      <p class="heading  page-subtitle  t--center">Apr 2014&mdash;Oct 2014</p>
      <p class="t--center">I worked briefly with Fabio Basile and Ryan Murphy to update the visual language on the Wonder PL iOS app. I updated its icon and assets, supporting the new iPhone 6 plus. We also started working on a feature we called Shop Motion, which allowed users to purchase goods that were featured in a video. Developed by Cong Le and Sherman Lo.</p>

      <p class="t--center">I designed the web application, internally known as Romeo, for uploading videos and collaborating on projects with stakeholders. It allowed film-makers and production houses to comment on cuts of a video and then re-upload assets and re-cuts for further assessment. Built as a single page app in Angular, I worked with developers Johan Goransson and Phil Shum to refine the flows, animation and visual design of the app.</p>
