    <h2 class="heading  alpha  page-title">Wonder PL for web</h2>
    <p class="t--center">I designed the web application, internally known as Romeo, for uploading videos and collaborating on projects with stakeholders. It allowed film-makers and production houses to comment on cuts of a video and then re-upload assets and re-cuts for further assessment. We interviewed a few professional indie film-makers to test our hypotheses and if the product was viable. Built as a single page app in Angular, I worked with developers Johan Goransson and Phil Shum to refine the flows and visual design of the app.</p>

We also started working on a feature we called Shop Motion, which allowed users to purchase goods that were featured in a video. Developed by Cong Le and Sherman Lo.</p>
