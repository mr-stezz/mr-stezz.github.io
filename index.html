OnCare provides tools that make caring for the elderly easier. The business has three apps which I helped prototype and design, including a React Native app for both iOS and Android which serves care workers and a responsive web app that serves agencies, care workers and family members of the patients. As well as working on product strategy, early prototypes and informing the User Experience, I also worked on the creative direction.</p>

  <p class="text-col">Carmen, now known as <a href="http://www.getfrisbee.com" title="frisbee, the continuous feedback platform, helping employees and organisations grow, every day.">Frisbee</a>, is a web based peer-to-peer workplace feedback tool from the <a href="https://foundersfactory.com/portfolio/">Founders Factory incubator</a>. The idea of Carmen, a portable record of your professional growth, bore out of the need to improve inefficient review systems that serve as a check box exercise at many large corps. My involvement included prototyping early ideas, conducting user interviews to find out peoples needs for getting candid, helpful feedback and designing the UI for the web app.</p>

  <p class="text-col">Robin was a proof of concept workplace training application from the <a href="https://foundersfactory.com/portfolio/">Founders Factory incubator</a>. Specifically geared towards sales reps, it was built to solve the problem of getting new reps up to speed, faster and more efficiently. We focused on delivering an enjoyable experience around the existing content companies already have and maximising on its impact by offering features like engagement stats and a way to star slides to establish a feedback loop to management. A Questions feature was designed to gauge the output from individual team members. These features came from interviewing our development partners who used Robin during its early days to inform our product decisions.</p>
