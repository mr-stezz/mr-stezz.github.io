    <h2 class="heading  alpha  page-title">State for web</h2>
    <p>I've overseen the redesign of State.com with <a href="https://twitter.com/alexnako" title="Product Designer, Alex Nako">Alex Nako</a> and the team at State. Among some of the changes we've introduced long-form opinions, an easier way to express your opinion and light touch interactions like topic related polls. I'm now working on optimizing the site to reduce friction in the sign up process by conducting a series of focused tests.</p>

    <p>I worked on updating Android&lsquo;s &rsquo;find friends&lsquo; flow within the app. I also lead the design on overhauling the app with Alexandros Schillings developing to support Google&lsquo;s new Material Design, including a new Launcher icon. Unfortunately, the app is no longer in development.</p>

    <h2 class="heading  alpha  page-title">Wonder PL for web</h2>
    <p>I designed the web application, internally known as Romeo, for uploading videos and collaborating on projects with stakeholders. It allowed film-makers and production houses to comment on cuts of a video and then re-upload assets and re-cuts for further assessment. We interviewed a few professional indie film-makers to test our hypotheses and if the product was viable. Built as a single page app in Angular, I worked with developers Johan Goransson and Phil Shum to refine the flows and visual design of the app. Unfortunately, the app is no longer in development.</p>

    <h2 class="heading  alpha  page-title">Wonder PL for iOS</h2>
    <p>I worked briefly with Fabio Basile and Ryan Murphy to update the visual language on the Wonder PL iOS app. I updated its icon and assets, supporting the new iPhone 6 plus. We also started working on a feature we called Shop Motion, which allowed users to purchase goods that were featured in a video. Developed by Cong Le and Sherman Lo. Unfortunately, the app is no longer in development.</p>

    <p>Together with Aaron Stezycki and Anthony Williams, we designed a new visual style for the site, with an approach to modularising components, using scalable graphics and making the experience more holistic. Developed with Barry Burrows, Mike Tinson and Stuart Philbin.</p>
