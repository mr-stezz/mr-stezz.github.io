    <p class="text-col">State is the worldâ€™s structured opinion network. With the help and support of a world-class team, I helped craft new experiences in the app, on the web and through email. We worked in quick design sprint cycles to iterate our work fast and efficiently. User tests and diary studies provided us with quantitative and qualitative feedback to further explore different design solutions to the problems we faced. My time at State was a great learning experience where I learned to value testing and measuring the impact of an assumed solution.</p>
